# Vegan Skincare Final Project

This project was created by Brodie Henson as the final project for JOU4364: Advanced Web Apps for Communicators at the University of Florida.

This app allows users to search for vegan skincare products offered at Ulta, r.e.m. beauty and Pacifica. It was made primarily using Python, MySQL and PHP. Python was used to scrape product, brand and price information from Ulta, r.e.m. beauty and Pacifica and written to a CSV file. MySQL was used to create a database containing the CSV files. PHP was used with HTML to create an interactive web app that connected with the MySQL database.
